# Project Description for "Data Statistics Web App"

!(image.png)

This Data Statistics Web App is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to upload an Excel file and explore various statistical metrics and visualizations for a selected column. It supports different types of data, including categorical, numerical, and date-based columns, and provides a simple interface for data analysis.

Key Features:
Upload Excel File: Users can upload an Excel file (.xlsx format) to load the data into the app.

Data Preview: After uploading, the app displays a preview of the data in a table.

Column Selection: Users can select a column to analyze from the data.

Statistical Analysis: The app computes basic statistical metrics:

Mean (for numerical and date data)

Median (for numerical and date data)

Mode (for all data types) The app will display warnings for categorical columns where mean and median are not applicable.

Visualizations:

Date Columns: A bar chart with dates on the x-axis and their frequency on the y-axis, along with lines for mean, median, and mode.

Categorical Columns: A bar chart showing the distribution of categories and their counts.

Numeric Columns: A histogram displaying the distribution of numerical values, with lines indicating mean, median, and mode.

Technologies Used:
Streamlit: For building the web interface.

Pandas: For data manipulation and reading Excel files.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations (bar charts, histograms).

NumPy: For handling numerical data and computations.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Streamlit

Pandas

Matplotlib

NumPy

Example of Data Preview and Analysis
Once the user uploads an Excel file, the app will show a preview of the data and allow column selection for analysis. It calculates the mean, median, and mode of the selected column, along with displaying relevant visualizations based on the data type.
